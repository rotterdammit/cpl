Comparelist (intentionally misspelled)

The idea is to have an intuitive and easy to use comparison list/table function. It can highlight columns, show differences, sort columns and has a unique logic to always display it correctly within the viewport. Additional support for mouse dragging, keyboard navigation and integration of a floating header bar when scrolling, etc.
